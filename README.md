Steps to use:\
1.) Download Blackhole.blend or select your own Blender project\
2.) Create a new Google Drive folder and upload your Blender file 
3.) Update all instances of string "/Blender3.5/" and "blender-3.5.1-" if you are using a previous version of Blender\
4.) Update the filename to the Google Drive location of your Blender file\
5.) Updated the the following file path: "/content/drive/MyDrive/BlenderRenders/render" to the "/content/MyDrive/new_folder_name/name_of_rendered_files"\
5.) Run the notebook. Rendered images will land in the Google Drive folder where your Blender file lives.
